# About

## Hi there, thank you for visiting!

My name is Eko.

I love writing code and building things but more often than not
I break things an systems instead.  
You can find me on Github working on personal and open source projects.  
I also write on Quora or Medium sometimes.  
I enjoy good food, coffee, and travelling a lot.  
Cheers!
